smartmontools (6.4+svn4214-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Previous versions of the smartmontools package included a tool
  update-smart-drivedb which downloaded updated drive definitions
  from the smartmontools website and stored them at

      /var/lib/smartmontools/drivedb/drivedb.h

  This tool did not download the definitions in a secure manner and
  so the feature has been removed in this version.  Future drive DB
  updates will be propagated via normal Debian package updates,
  including backports.

  If you already have a drivedb.h file at that location, smartctl
  will continue to use it.

smartmontools (5.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Prior to 5.37 temperature logging was enabled per default on SCSI disks, as
  of version 5.37 please use the -W option in smartd.conf.
