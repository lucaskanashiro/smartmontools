Description: Various manpage improvements.

Enable and fix warnings from 'man' and 'groff'.

Change `` to ".

Split lines longer than about 80 characters into two or more
lines.  References:

  1) man-pages(7) from package \"man-pages\" or
  \"www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages\" section 7 or
  \"man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man-pages.7.html\":

  New sentences should be started on new lines.
  This makes it easier to see the effect of patches,
  which often operate at the level of individual sentences.

Remove space at end of lines.

The space between sentences in "roff" is two spaces.

Better is to begin each sentence on a new line to avoid different
writers' conventions.

Change \' (acute) to \(aq, if used as a quote.

Change \' (acute) to ', if used as an apostrophe.

Change - to \(en (en-dash) for a numeric range.

Protect a full stop (.) with \&, if

  a) it can be transported to the first column, when the line is
     reformatted (split).
  b) it is the last part of an abbreviation that does not end a
     sentence.

Add a (no-break, "\ ") space between a number and an unit as these
are not one entity

Change a hyphen-minus to a minus (\-), if in front of a name for an option

Remove space in the first column, if not intended.
